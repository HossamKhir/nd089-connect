# IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

This session is going to be recorded so that my performance as a Session Lead can be assessed by the Udacity team.
These recordings will not be shared with students or posted on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, etc.
They will also not be used in marketing materials.
When I start recording, you will be asked to consent to the recording or leave the meeting.
If you leave because you do not wish to be recorded, this will be counted as an excused absence.
