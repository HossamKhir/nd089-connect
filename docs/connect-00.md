# AI. What, when, who, and why?

[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) (1912-1954)

Regarded as the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

# Alan Turing

- The Turing machine
- Cracking the Enigma machine
- **The Turing test**

---

# The Turing test

- an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent"
- A computer could be said to *"think"* if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.

# AI. What, when, who, and why?

> "AI is likely to be either the best, or the worst thing to happen to humanity"
*Stephen Hawkings*

---

# Official birth of Modern AI

## The Dartmouth Conference (1956)

> Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do

*Herbert Simon, 1965*

> In from 3 to 8 years we will have a machine with the general
intelligence of an average human being

*Marvin Minsky, 1970*

# Narrow AI & General AI

| Narrow "weak" | General |
| :-: | :-: |
| Any AI that can outperform a human *in a narrowly defined and structured task* | Machines that can reason and think *just like a human is capable of doing* |
| Performs a single function | Allows machines to apply knowledge and skills in different contexts |

[Nice article on the subject](https://levity.ai/blog/general-ai-vs-narrow-ai)
