# Vectors

1. if $\overrightarrow{w} = (-25, 10)$, then what is $\frac{1}{5}\overrightarrow{w}$?
2. if $\overrightarrow{v}$ has **magnitude** of 3 units, and makes an angle of $160\degree$ w/ +ve $x$-axis, then
   1. $\left\lVert5\overrightarrow{v}\right\rVert=?$ units
   2. $5\overrightarrow{v}$ makes an angle of $?\degree$ w/ +ve $x$-axis

# Vectors, cont. 1

![bg right:50%](../data/vectors-001.png)

$\overrightarrow{v}$ starts at origin and ends at $E$, if $\frac{1}{5}\overrightarrow{v}$ starts at origin, where it ends?

# Vectors, cont. 2

[Graph](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/ynwjkqbg)

1. if $\overrightarrow{v}=\begin{bmatrix}-5 & -4\end{bmatrix}$, then unit vector in its direction is ____
2. $\overrightarrow{v}=\begin{bmatrix}2 & 7\end{bmatrix}$, find unit vector in its direction.
