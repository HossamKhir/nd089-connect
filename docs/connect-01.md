# Quick review: Why Python programming?

- case sensitivity
- spacing
- errors

---

# case sensitive

means that a variable (or a literal) should always be consistent in terms of letter casing

`PI` is different from `pi` is different from `Pi`

---

# Spacing

```java
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.*;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){

  }
}
```

```py

def main(args):
  pass

```
