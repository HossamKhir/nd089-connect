> I often tell my students not to be misled by the name 'artificial intelligence' - there is nothing artificial about it.
> AI is made by humans, intended to behave by humans, and, ultimately, to impact humans' lives and human society.

# Project overview

- `check_images.py` is the main file of your project
- look for `TODO:` comments to work on tasks
- some files have suffix `_hints.py`, those contains extra hints to help with objectives
- sub-lessons help you identify which lessons to review
- sub-lessons also have reference to module documentations
- sub-lessons may contain example code (it is useful)
- N.B: `listdir` lists all files (even hidden ones we don't need)
