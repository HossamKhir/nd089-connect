# Quick review

- Calculus is about 2 main topics, _derivatives_ & _integrals_.
- Derivatives & Integrals are in some sense opposite operations.
- Derivative is officially defined as `instantaneous rate of change`, but it is merely a constant approximation.
- A derivative is formally calculated with `limits`, which is the approximate value if the change **approaches** zero.
- A derivative is graphed as the slope of the tangent to the graph of the function at a given point.

- **The chain rule** is one of the most important rules in calculus (and later on, other mathematical fields).
- The integral of a functions is geometrically the (signed) area under the curve of the function.
- Integrals are also synonymous with _anti-derivative_.
- Multi-variate chain rule relies on partial derivation, which means any variable but the one being differentiated against, is kept as constant.

$$
f(x) = sin(x^2) \\
h(x) = x^2 \to h \\
f(x) = sin(h)
$$

$$
y = f^2 g \\
f = x^2; g = sin(x)

$$

$$
N(\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
$$

# Tips & tricks

- `SymPy`: a python module for symbolic math operations.
- [derivative-calculator](https://www.derivative-calculator.net/) & [integral-calculator](https://www.integral-calculator.com/): websites for finding differentiations & integrations, and ability to observe the steps.
