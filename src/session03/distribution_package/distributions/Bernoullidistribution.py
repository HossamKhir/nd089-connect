"""The Bernoulli distribution"""
import math

# TODO: import the parent distribution for the Bernoulli distribution
# NOTE: a Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the Binomial distribution
#   where number of trials equals to 1

# TODO: define a bernoulli class that inherits from a parent distribution
# TODO: a good practice is to have a pydoc for the class

# TODO: type in code for constructor (a magic method)
# NOTE: Bernoulli uses only 2 arguments p (probability) and q = 1-p, so
# actually one

# TODO: implement methods to calculate mean, standard deviation, and PMF
# NOTE: the mean for the Bernoulli distribution is `p`
# NOTE: the variance for the Bernoulli distribution is `p*q`
# NOTE: the PMF for Bernoulli distribution is `(p**k)*(q**(1-k))`
