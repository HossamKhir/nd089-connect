# TODO: std library import
# TODO: parent class import

# TODO: define a new class for continuous uniform distribution, that is a child
# of distribution

# TODO: define a constructor
# NOTE: Continuous uniform distribution has 2 args: a (inclusive start of range)
# and b (inclusive end of range)

# TODO: define methods for calculating mean, std deviation & PDF
# NOTE: PDF of continuous uniform distribution is 1/b-a for x in [a,b], 0 otherwise
# NOTE: mean is (a + b) / 2
# NOTE: variance is ((b - a)^2) / 12
